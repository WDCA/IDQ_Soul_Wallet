Highlighting its ability to handle smart contracts, it is a versatile blockchain platform that allows users to set up their own contracts for any purpose.Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) allows start-ups to Enabling innovation on the Filecoin network, the RFS includes a star guide for start-ups, as well as use cases and tools DAO, decentralised science, storage of open access papers, reproducible carriers or social implementations, can be used to store experimental results. Secondary voting contributes to the fairness of the review process and to the reproducibility of scientific codes.n Filecoin Green aims to create a sustainable network for storing data. DQ projects that can drive this effort, such as building on-chain credentials to verify sustainable claims, tokenising RECs with FVMs and creating an open marketplace for companies to buy sustainable claims, and making the blockchain more popular and us We started to realise that there are ways to use it. So we propose in this ETH Tokyo Hackathon how to make blockchain work in all kinds of applications!

catchphrase: 【Web 3 Authentic】

# Architecture

In our designed arhitecture, each user has a unique ID, which is mapped to IPFS/FVM. The IPFS/FVM can be used to execute smart contracts, which transfers data from one DID or address to another user. The data is also added as product usage on the system, and can be popuplated using a QR code. 

Filecoin Virtua Machine (FVM) is used to allow automatic execution of the smart contracts.
